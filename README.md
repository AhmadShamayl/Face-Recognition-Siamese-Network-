Face Recognition using Siamese Network
Overview
This project demonstrates a face recognition system using a Siamese network. The model is designed to identify and verify faces by learning the similarity between them. The approach leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) within the TensorFlow framework.

Features
Face detection and alignment
Feature extraction using CNNs
Siamese network for face similarity comparison
Training on custom datasets
Real-time face recognition
Requirements
Python 3.6+
TensorFlow
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
Installation
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facerecognition.git
cd facerecognition
Install the required packages:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset Preparation
Ensure you have the following directory structure for your datasets:

kotlin

data/
├── positive/
├── negative/
└── anchor/
positive/: Images of the person you want to recognize
negative/: Images of other people
anchor/: Additional images of the person you want to recognize
Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model:


jupyter notebook Face\ recognition.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Example
Here is a brief example of how to use the trained model for face recognition:


import cv2
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load the trained model
model = load_model('path_to_your_model.h5')

# Read the input image
image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg')
image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Preprocess the image
# (Apply the same preprocessing steps used during training)

# Predict the similarity
result = model.predict([anchor_image, image])

print("Similarity score:", result)
Results
